# Psychic-Game
Hello, I created this game as an assignment from the bootcamp.
The instructions will pop up as you open the game in the browser.
How to play: All you need is to guess the letter that computer is thinking of. Sounds easy right? 
You only have 9 tries to guess the correct one and become a psychic.
If win or lose, the window alert will pop up to inform you.
Lastly, to restart the game you won/t have to reload the page, the new will begin as soon as you are out of nine tries.
Good luck!
