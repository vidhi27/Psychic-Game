# Welcome to Psychic Game
<p>Hello, I created this game as a part of an assignment from the bootcamp.
<br>
<br>The instructions will pop up as you open the game in the browser.
<br>How to play: All you need is to guess the letter from a-z(in lowercase) that computer is thinking of. Sounds easy right? 
<br>You only have 9 tries to guess the correct one and become a psychic.
<br>If win or lose, the window alert will pop up to inform you.
<br>Lastly, to restart the game you won/t have to reload the page, the new will begin as soon as you are out of nine tries.
<br>Good luck!</p>
<strong>Note: For some sound effects open the game in IE (Explorer). Enjoy!</strong>
